   → Feature clearly defined: Content extraction tool for web links
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: End users seeking clean text content
   → Actions: URL input, content extraction, text display, copy functionality
   → Data: URLs, extracted text content, subtitle tracks, timestamps
   → Constraints: YouTube and Naver blog support, mobile-first design, PWA
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All major aspects are well-defined in the description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow provided from landing page to content display
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement derived from specified functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   → URLs, Content, Subtitles, Languages, Timestamps
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Spec complete with clear requirements and user scenarios
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: YouTube URL 지원 범위를 명확히 해주세요. → A: 모든 YouTube 도메인 (youtube.com, youtu.be, m.youtube.com, www.youtube.com)
- Q: Naver 블로그 URL 지원 형식을 명확히 해주세요. → A: PC 크롤링 우선, 실패 시 모바일 버전으로 재시도
- Q: 타임스탬프 표시 형식을 명확히 해주세요. → A: 동적 형식 (1시간 미만은 MM:SS, 이상은 HH:MM:SS)
- Q: YouTube 자막이 없는 경우의 처리 방식을 명확히 해주세요. → A: 자막 없음 안내 후 비디오 제목/설명 추출 시도

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a content consumer, I want to extract clean, readable text from web content (YouTube videos and Naver blog posts) so that I can easily read, copy, and use the content without distractions from ads, navigation elements, or video interfaces.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the Textify landing page, **When** I paste a valid YouTube video URL and click "Extract", **Then** the system displays the video's subtitle text in a clean, scrollable format
2. **Given** I am viewing extracted YouTube subtitle content, **When** I click the "Copy to Clipboard" button, **Then** the entire text is copied and a success message appears briefly
3. **Given** I am on the Textify landing page, **When** I paste a valid Naver blog URL and click "Extract", **Then** the system displays the blog's main content text without ads or navigation elements
4. **Given** I have extracted YouTube content with multiple language tracks, **When** I select a different language from the dropdown, **Then** the text area updates to show subtitles in the selected language
5. **Given** I am viewing YouTube subtitle content, **When** I toggle the timestamp switch, **Then** timestamps are shown or hidden in the extracted text accordingly
6. **Given** I paste an invalid or unsupported URL, **When** I click "Extract", **Then** a modal popup displays "유효한 링크가 아닙니다" and suggests valid URL formats

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a YouTube video has no subtitles available? → System displays "자막 없음" notice and attempts to extract video title and description as alternative content
- How does the system handle private or restricted content?
- What occurs when a Naver blog post has minimal text content?
- How does the system respond to network connectivity issues during extraction?
- What happens when subtitle tracks are in languages not supported by the system?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept YouTube video URLs from all supported domains (youtube.com, youtu.be, m.youtube.com, www.youtube.com) and extract available subtitle/caption content
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept Naver blog URLs and attempt PC format extraction first, falling back to mobile format if PC extraction fails, and extract main body text content
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback when a URL format is recognized as valid
- **FR-004**: System MUST display extracted content in a clean, scrollable text area
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a single-click copy-to-clipboard functionality for extracted text
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a brief success message when content is copied to clipboard
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide language selection dropdown for YouTube videos with multiple subtitle tracks
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide timestamp toggle functionality for YouTube subtitle content using dynamic format (MM:SS for videos under 1 hour, HH:MM:SS for longer videos)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display loading indicators during content extraction process
- **FR-010**: System MUST display clear, user-friendly error messages (such as "유효한 링크가 아닙니다") in modal/popup format for unsupported URLs, private content, or extraction failures
- **FR-011**: System MUST strip away ads, navigation menus, sidebars, and non-essential elements from Naver blog content
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle both auto-generated and manually uploaded YouTube captions, and when no captions are available, display notice and extract video title and description as fallback content
- **FR-013**: System MUST operate as a single-page application without full page reloads
- **FR-014**: System MUST function as a Progressive Web App (PWA) allowing home screen installation
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide mobile-first, fully responsive design across all device sizes
- **FR-016**: System MUST complete typical extraction requests within 3 seconds

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **URL**: Web link input provided by user, validated for supported formats (YouTube, Naver blog)
- **Content**: Extracted text data including main body, subtitles, or captions
- **Subtitle Track**: Individual language track from YouTube videos with associated language code
- **Language**: Available subtitle languages for multi-language YouTube content
- **Timestamp**: Time markers associated with YouTube subtitle segments, toggleable for display
