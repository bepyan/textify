# Feature Specification: Textify Content Extraction Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-content`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a content extraction tool named \"Textify\". The primary goal of this tool is to provide users with a clean, text-only version of content from various web links, starting with YouTube videos and Naver blogs."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Content extraction tool for web links (YouTube, Naver blogs)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: End users seeking clean text content
   → Actions: URL input, content extraction, text display, copy functionality
   → Data: URLs, extracted text content, subtitle tracks, timestamps
   → Constraints: Mobile-first, PWA, 3-second response time
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All requirements clearly specified in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: URL input → extraction → display → copy
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → YouTube subtitle extraction, Naver blog parsing, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → URL, ExtractedContent, SubtitleTrack, ExtractionResult
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
   → Implementation details avoided
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a content consumer, I want to extract clean, readable text from web content (YouTube videos and Naver blog posts) so that I can quickly read and copy the essential information without distractions from ads, navigation, or multimedia elements.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the Textify landing page, **When** they see the interface, **Then** they should see a single prominent text input field and an "Extract" button with clear instructions.

2. **Given** a user pastes a valid YouTube video URL, **When** they click "Extract", **Then** the system should display a loading indicator and extract the complete subtitle/caption text within 3 seconds.

3. **Given** a user pastes a valid Naver blog URL, **When** they click "Extract", **Then** the system should parse the HTML and display only the main body text, stripped of ads and navigation elements.

4. **Given** extracted content is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Copy to Clipboard", **Then** the entire text should be copied and a brief success message should appear.

5. **Given** a YouTube video with multiple subtitle languages, **When** content is extracted, **Then** a language selection dropdown should appear allowing the user to switch between available languages.

6. **Given** YouTube subtitles are displayed, **When** the user toggles the timestamp option, **Then** timestamps should be shown or hidden in the extracted text accordingly.

7. **Given** a user enters an unsupported URL or a URL that cannot be accessed, **When** they attempt extraction, **Then** a clear, user-friendly error message should be displayed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a YouTube video has no captions available (auto-generated or manual)?
- How does the system handle private or restricted YouTube videos?
- What occurs when a Naver blog post has minimal text content or is primarily images?
- How does the application behave when network connectivity is poor or intermittent?
- What happens when a user inputs a malformed or completely invalid URL?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract complete subtitle/caption scripts from YouTube video URLs, handling both auto-generated and manually uploaded captions
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse Naver blog post HTML and extract main body text while removing ads, navigation menus, sidebars, and non-essential elements
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide immediate visual feedback when a URL format is recognized as valid during input
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a loading indicator during the extraction process
- **FR-005**: System MUST present extracted content in a clean, scrollable text area
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a "Copy to Clipboard" button that copies the entire extracted text
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a brief success message when content is successfully copied to clipboard
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a language selection dropdown for YouTube videos with multiple subtitle tracks
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a timestamp toggle for YouTube subtitles to show or hide timestamps in extracted text
- **FR-010**: System MUST display clear, user-friendly error messages for unsupported URLs, inaccessible content, or extraction failures
- **FR-011**: System MUST complete extraction and display results within 3 seconds for typical requests
- **FR-012**: System MUST function as a Progressive Web App (PWA) allowing installation to device home screens
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a mobile-first, fully responsive design that works on devices from small phones to large desktops
- **FR-014**: System MUST operate as a single-page application (SPA) without full page reloads

### Key Entities

- **URL**: Represents the web link input by the user (YouTube video URL or Naver blog URL)
- **ExtractedContent**: The clean, text-only content extracted from the source URL
- **SubtitleTrack**: For YouTube videos, represents available language options for captions
- **ExtractionResult**: The complete result of an extraction operation, including content, metadata, and status
- **UserSession**: Temporary session data for the current extraction operation
